SECTION 3: DETECTED ANOMALIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. B7 (LTE): Passed all config stages but missing in QXDM
2. B32 (LTE): Present in QXDM but missing in UE Capability
3. B38 (LTE): Passed all config stages but missing in QXDM
4. B46 (LTE): Passed all config stages but missing in QXDM
5. B64 (LTE): Present in device logs but NOT in RFC
6. B66 (LTE): Present in QXDM but missing in UE Capability
7. B68 (LTE): Present in QXDM but missing in UE Capability
8. B71 (LTE): Present in QXDM but missing in UE Capability
9. n25 (NR_NSA): Passed all config stages but missing in QXDM

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4: SUMMARY STATISTICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LTE Bands:    Total:  31  |  Enabled:  21  |  Filtered:   0  |  Anomalies: 8
NR SA Bands:  Total:  23  |  Enabled:  20  |  Filtered:   3  |  Anomalies: 0
NR NSA Bands: Total:  23  |  Enabled:  17  |  Filtered:   5  |  Anomalies: 1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5: MDB CONTEXT (Location-Based Band Information)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: MDB (mcc2bands) is NOT part of the filtering pipeline. This information is
provided as context for your expert review. MDB shows bands allowed for a specific
location (MCC) at runtime - QXDM logs already reflect MDB filtering applied.

Target MCC: Context: 18 LTE, 11 NR

MDB Allowed LTE Bands (18): B2, B4, B5, B7, B12, B13, B14, B17, B25, B26, B29, B30, B38, B41, B46, B48, B66, B71
MDB Allowed NR Bands (14): n1, n4, n24, n25, n28, n40, n47, n65, n69, n70, n76, n257, n259, n260

Consider: If a band passes all config stages but is missing from QXDM,
check if it's excluded by MDB for this location.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6: REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please provide:
1. Validation of the automated findings - are the PASS/FAIL determinations correct?
2. Explanation for each anomaly - what are the possible root causes?
3. Impact assessment - how critical is each issue?
4. Recommended actions to resolve anomalies
5. Overall verdict: Is this configuration safe for deployment?

Format your response with clear sections for each anomaly.
Use your domain knowledge of Qualcomm modem configurations to provide insights.
