SECTION 3: DETECTED ANOMALIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No anomalies detected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4: SUMMARY STATISTICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LTE Bands:    Total:  28  |  Enabled:  27  |  Filtered:   1  |  Anomalies: 0
NR SA Bands:  Total:  23  |  Enabled:  20  |  Filtered:   3  |  Anomalies: 0
NR NSA Bands: Total:  23  |  Enabled:  17  |  Filtered:   0  |  Anomalies: 0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5: MDB CONTEXT (Location-Based Band Information)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: MDB (mcc2bands) is NOT part of the filtering pipeline. This information is
provided as context for your expert review. MDB shows bands allowed for a specific
location (MCC) at runtime - QXDM logs already reflect MDB filtering applied.

Target MCC: Context: 0 LTE, 0 NR

MDB Allowed LTE Bands (0): None
MDB Allowed NR Bands (0): None

Consider: If a band passes all config stages but is missing from QXDM,
check if it's excluded by MDB for this location.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6: REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please provide:
1. Validation of the automated findings - are the PASS/FAIL determinations correct?
2. Explanation for each anomaly - what are the possible root causes?
3. Impact assessment - how critical is each issue?
4. Recommended actions to resolve anomalies
5. Overall verdict: Is this configuration safe for deployment?

Format your response with clear sections for each anomaly.
Use your domain knowledge of Qualcomm modem configurations to provide insights.
